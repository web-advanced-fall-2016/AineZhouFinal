Final Assignment

Attempt: To create a infinite carousel for a paper.js animations that relate to my Thesis project but was unable to link paper.js canvas animations to my js script.

Made: An infinite carousel with some of my primer material for my Thesis project - some should have animation from the paper.js

Used: Jquery & attempted paper.js

Thesis: An VR installation that evokes the feeling of loss and a sense that something is missing. I previously had a few static images in a booklet that prims the user before they view the project in VR. For this class, I made a static website page that links out to my portfolio and Linkedin while a the static images loop, giving the user just enough time to realize something is slightly off about them.
